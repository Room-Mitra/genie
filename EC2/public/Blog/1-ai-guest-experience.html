    <div class="container">
        <p>In a world where personalization is key, the hospitality industry is undergoing a quiet revolution.
            Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer just a buzzword — it’s now at the heart of how modern hotels
            deliver exceptional guest experiences.</p>

        <h2>1. Smart Rooms: The New Concierge</h2>
        <p>Guests today expect more than just clean sheets and fast Wi-Fi. With smart room technology, powered by AI
            assistants like Alexa or custom voice agents, guests can control lighting, request services, set alarms, or
            ask for local recommendations — all hands-free.</p>

        <h2>2. Chatbots: 24/7 Front Desk Assistants</h2>
        <p>AI-powered chatbots on WhatsApp and websites allow hotels to engage with guests before, during, and after
            their stay. They can answer FAQs, take room service orders, book spa slots, or even upsell premium services
            — all automatically and instantly.</p>

        <h2>3. Hyper-Personalization</h2>
        <p>Using AI, hotels can analyze guest preferences and behavior to provide tailored experiences — from
            recommending specific dishes to customizing room temperature or offering curated local experiences. This
            level of personalization was once reserved for luxury chains, but now it's becoming standard.</p>

        <h2>4. Operational Efficiency</h2>
        <p>AI helps automate repetitive tasks like check-in/check-out, housekeeping requests, and feedback collection.
            This not only reduces operational costs but also frees up staff to focus on high-touch, human interactions
            that matter most.</p>

        <h2>5. Real-Time Feedback & Improvement</h2>
        <p>Modern AI tools allow hotels to collect real-time feedback and detect guest dissatisfaction proactively. This
            enables quicker recovery, better reviews, and improved brand loyalty.</p>

        <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
        <p>AI doesn’t replace human hospitality — it enhances it. By streamlining backend processes and empowering
            guests with instant service, hotels can achieve the golden trifecta: increased revenue, reduced operational
            load, and delighted guests.</p>
